EE219 - Winter 2017 - Project 5

Team:
	Xiao Yan - 704534585
	Jingxian Xu - 604721196
	Wenrui Wu - 104778067

Assumptions:
	You have the needed data in place, and they are stored under the directory tweet_data/ and test_data/ respectively.

Packages we used (library dependencies):
	sklearn:
		http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ 
	matplotlib:
		http://matplotlib.org/
	statsmodels:
		http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/

How to run the code:
	We wrote a Makefile so you can run with:
		$ make run
	You can also look into the Makefile to run each part separately, but take heed that part2n3.py with --savefeat flag will generate files that summarize features extracted from tweet data for part4.py and part5.py to use (so that they don't need to read the tweet data again).
