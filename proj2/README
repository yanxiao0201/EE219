EE219 - Winter 2017 - Project 2

Team:
	Xiao Yan - 704534585
	Jingxian Xu - 604721196
	Wenrui Wu - 104778067

Packages we used (library dependencies):
	sklearn:
		http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ 
	matplotlib:
		http://matplotlib.org/
	Natural Language Toolkit:
		http://www.nltk.org/

How to run the code:
	You can use "make run" to run all the code. Like this:

	$ make run

	If a "Permission denied" error occurs, try:

	$ chmod +x run_all.sh

	...and "make run" again. It is because we use a shell script to automate the execution of all code written...

	Alternatively, you can execute each individual question in the project specification. For example:

	$ python question_b.py

	Notice that question (j) is split into two parts. "question_j.py" is the code to generate report for the Naive Bayes method, and "question_j_svm.py" corresponds to the SVM method.
	"question_j_svm_alternative.py" is the code for a side note at the end of the report.
